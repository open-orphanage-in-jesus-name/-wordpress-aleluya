# For God So loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that all who believe in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.

Praise Jesus, this is a wordpress plugin. We hope to make many additions, right now it is meant to work alongside the [android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openorphanage.m1aleluya2)

### Mission
ðŸ•† Serve the Lord, Jesus, by providing free and open source software for orphanages, to help manage their operations and communications and to aid with meeting needs through fundraising and sponsorship.

## Additional notes:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Guten Block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block).

Below you will find some information on how to run scripts.

>You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block).

### ðŸ‘‰  `npm start`
- Use to compile and run the block in development mode.
- Watches for any changes and reports back any errors in your code.

### ðŸ‘‰  `npm run build`
- Use to build production code for your block inside `dist` folder.
- Runs once and reports back the gzip file sizes of the produced code.

### ðŸ‘‰  `npm run eject`
- Use to eject your plugin out of `create-guten-block`.
- Provides all the configurations so you can customize the project as you want.
- It's a one-way street, `eject` and you have to maintain everything yourself.
- You don't normally have to `eject` a project because by ejecting you lose the connection with `create-guten-block` and from there onwards you have to update and maintain all the dependencies on your own.
